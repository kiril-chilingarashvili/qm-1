    "\n",
    "### We have seen that to any free particle with momentum $p$, we can associate a plane wave, or a “matter wave”, with de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda = h / p$, with $p = |\\vec{p}|$. The question is, **waves of what**? Well, this wave is eventually recognized as an example of what one calls the wavefunction. The wavefunction, as we will see is governed by the Schrodinger equation. As we have hinted, the wavefunction gives us information about probabilities, and we will develop this idea in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the wave have directional or polarization properties like electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave? Yes, there is an analog of this, although we will not delve into it now. The analog of polarization corresponds to spin! The effects of spin are negligible in many cases (small velocities, no magnetic fields, for example) and for this reason, we just use a scalar wave, a complex number\n",

    "This is very strange! As we review now, for ordinary waves that propagate in the rest frame of a medium (like sound waves or water waves) Galilean observers will find frequency changes but no change in wavelength. This is intuitively clear: to find the wavelength one need only take a picture of the wave at some given time, and both observers looking at the picture will agree on the value of the wavelength. On the other hand to measure frequency, each observers must wait some time to see a full period of the wave go through them. This will take different time for the different observers.\n",
    "   Let us demonstrate these claims quantitatively. We begin with the statement that the phase ? = kx ? ?t of such a wave is a Galilean invariant. The wave itself may be cos ? or sin ? or some combination, but the fact is that the physical value of the wave at any point and time must be agreed by the two observers. The wave is an observable. Since all the features of the wave (peaks, zeroes,\n",
    "etc, etc) are controlled by the phase, the two observers must agree on the value of the phase.\n",
