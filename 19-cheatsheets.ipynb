    "To prove this result consider an arbitrary potential V (x) of range R, with a wall at x = 0. This potential, shown to the left in Figure 1, has a number of bound states, all of which are non-degenerate and can be counted. There is also a set of positive energy eigenstates: the scattering states that, belonging to a continuum, cannot be counted. Our proof requires the possibility of counting states, so we will introduce a second infinite wall, placed at x = L for large L. Of course, this will change the spectrum, but as L becomes larger and larger the changes will become smaller and smaller. We think of L as a regulator for the potential that discretizes the spectrum and thus enables us to enumerate the states. It does so because with two walls, the potential becomes a wide iinnfifinnite well and all states become bound states. The potential with the regulator wall is shown to the right in Figure 1.\n",

    "   The key of the proof will be to compare the counting of states in the regulated V =/= 0 potential to the counting of states in the V = 0 potential, also regulated with a second wall at x = L. Consider therefore the regulated V = 0 potential and the positive energy eigenstates. These correspond to the wavefunction ?(x) = sin kx, with the second wall requiring ?(x = L) = 0. We thus have\n",

    "We have calculated the time delay ∆t = 2n?t(E) associated with the reflected wavepacket that emerges from the range R potentials we have considered. If the time delay is negative, the reflected wavepacket emerges ahead of time. We can ask: Can we get an arbitrarily large negative time delay? The answer is no. A very large time delay would be a violation of causality. It would mean that the incoming packet is reflected even before it reaches x = R, which is impossible. In fact, the largest negative time delay would be realized (at least classically) if we had perfect reflection when the incoming packet hits\n",
