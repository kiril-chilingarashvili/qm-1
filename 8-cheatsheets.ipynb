    "## 8.1\tUncovering momentum space\n",
    "\n",
    "### We now begin a series of developments that lead to the idea of momentum space as a counterpoint or dual of position space. In this section the time dependence of wavefunctions will play no role. Therefore we will simply suppress time dependence. You can imagine all wavefunctions evaluated at time equal zero or at some arbitrary time $t_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We begin by recalling the key identities of Fourier’s theorem:\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} \\Psi(x) & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Phi(k) e^{ikx} \\mathop{dk} \\\\ \\Phi(k) & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\Psi(x) e^{-ikx}\\mathop{dx}  \\end{array} \\quad (1.1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fourier transform $\\Phi(k)$ has all the information carried by the wavefunction $\\Psi(x)$. This is clear because knowing $\\Phi(k)$ means knowing $\\Psi(x)$. The function $\\Phi(k)$ also acts as the weight with which we add the plane waves with momentum $\\hbar k$ to form $\\Psi(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will now see that the consistency of the above equations can be used to derive an integral representation for a delta function. Such a representation is a needed tool for our upcoming discussion. The idea is to replace $\\Phi(k)$ in the first equation by the value given in the second equation. In order to keep the notation clear, we must use $x'$ as a dummy variable of integration in the second equation.\n",

    "### We have\n",

We will record the integral representation of the delta function using the other sign:\n",
