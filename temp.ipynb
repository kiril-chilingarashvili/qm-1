    "1 Photoelectric Effect\n",
    "The photoelectric effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. When polished metal plates are irradiated, he observed, they may emit electrons, then called “photo-electrons”. The emitted electrons thus produce a photoelectric current. The key observations were:\n",
    "•• There is a threshold frequency ?0. Only for frequencies ? > ?0 is there a photoelectric current. The frequency ?0 depends on the metal and the configuration of the atoms at the surface. It is also affected by inhomogeneities.\n",
    "•• The magnitude of the photoelectric current is proportional to the intensity of the light source.\n",
    "•• Energy of the photoelectrons is independent of the intensity of the light source.\n",
    "   A natural explanation for the features in this effect didn’t come until 1905, when Einstein explained the above features by postulating that the energy in light is carried by discrete quanta (later called photons) with energy h?. Here h is Planck’s constant, the constant used by Planck to to produce a fit for the blackbody energy as a function of frequency.\n",

    "an electron may be ejected.\n",

    "   A given material has a characteristic energy W , called the work function, which is the minimum energy required to eject an electron.\tThis is not easily calculated because it is the result of an\n",
    "\n",
    "interaction of many electrons with the background of atoms. It is easily measured, however. When the surface of the material is irradiated, electrons in the material absorb the energy of the incoming photons. If the energy imparted on an electron by the absorption of a single photon is greater than\n",

    "h?0 = W ,\t(1.2)\n",
    "as it leads to a photoelectron with zero energy. For ? > ?0 the electrons will be ejected. Increasing the intensity of the light source increases the rate that photons arrive, which will increase the magnitude of the current, but will not change the energy of the photoelectrons because it does not change the energy of each incoming quanta.\n",
    "   Equation (1.2) allowed Einstein to make a prediction: The kinetic energy of the photo-electrons increases linearly with the frequency of light. Einstein’s prediction was confirmed experimentally by Millikan (1915) who measured carefully the photoelectron energies and confirmed their linear dependence on the energy. Millikan’s careful work allowed him to determine the value of Planck’s constant n to better than 1% accuracy! Still, skepticism remained and physicists were not yet convinced about the particle nature of these light quanta.\n",

    "   The classical counterpart of the Compton experiment is the scattering of electromagnetic waves off free electrons, called Thompson scattering. Here an electromagnetic wave is incident on a electron. The electric field of the wave shakes the electron which oscillates with the frequency of the incoming field. The electron oscillation produces a radiated field, of the same frequency as that of the incoming radiation. In classical Thomson scattering the differential scattering cross section is given by\n",

Indeed the quantity e2/(mc2) is called the classical electron radius and it is about 2.8 fm! not much bigger than a proton!\n",
    "   If we treat the light as photons, the elementary process going on is a collision between two particles; an incoming photon and a roughly stationary electron. Two facts can be quickly demonstrated:\n",

    "•• The photon cannot be absorbed by the electron. It is inconsistent with energy and momentum conservation (exercise)\n",

    "are about 300 eV, the expected peak represents instances where the atom is ionized by the collision and it is a fine approximation to consider the ejected electrons. The peak at ?i represents a process in which an electron receives some momentum from the photon but still remains bound. This is not very unlikely: the typical momentum of a bound electron is actually comparable to the momentum of the photon. In this case the photon scatters at 90? and the recoil momentum is carried by the whole atom. The relevant Compton wavelength is therefore that of the atom. Since the mass of the carbon atom is several thousands of times larger than the mass of the electron, the Compton wavelength of the atom is much smaller than the electron Compton wavelength and there should be no detectable change in the wavelength of the photon.1\n",

    "As we have seen, light behaves as both a particle and a wave. This kind of behavior is usually said to be a duality: the complete reality of the object is captured using both the wave and particle features of the object.

It is a particle with momentum p? but it also has a wavelength ?, a wave attribute, given by (2.16)\n",

In the famous Davisson-Germer experiment (1927) electrons are strike a metal surface and one finds that at certain angles there are peaks in the intensity of the scattered electrons. The peaks showed the effect of constructive interference from scattering off the lattice of atoms in the metal, demonstrating the wave nature of the electrons. One can also do two-slit interference with electrons, and the experiment can be done shooting one electron at a time. A recent experiment [arXiv:1310.8343] by Eibenberger et.al reports interference using molecules with 810 atoms and mass exceeding 10 000 amu (that’s 20 million times the mass of the electron!)\n",
