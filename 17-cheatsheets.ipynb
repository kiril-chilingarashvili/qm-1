At the energies for which $T = 1$ we have resonant scattering. The values of $E_7, E_8, \\ldots$ are indicated in the figure. There are three cases of resonant transmission for $0 < E < V_0$. Note that the spacing between the points where $T = 1$ grows as $\\mathcal{E}$ grows.\n",

    "### These gases have their electronic shells fully filled and are both very un-reactive and have high ionization energies. The potential is created by the nucleus, and becomes visible as the incident electron penetrates the electron cloud. This potential is a spherically symmetric attractive potential for the electrons – some kind of finite spherical well. In the experiment some electrons collide with the atoms and scatter, mostly bouncing back. We can thus view the reflection coefficient $R$ as a proxy for the scattering cross section!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ramsauer and Townsend reported a very unusual phenomenon. At very low energies, the scattering cross section was high. But the energy dependence was surprising. As the energy was increased the scattering went down towards zero, to go up again as the energy was increased further. Such mysterious behavior had no sensible classical explanation. What one has at play is quantum-mechanical resonant scattering. The cross section going to zero means the reflection coefficient going to zero, and the transmission coefficient going to one! The first resonant transmission happens for electrons of around one electron-volt (such electrons have a speed of about $600$ Km/s). \n",

    "### Figure 4 provides a sketch of both $R$ and $T$ as a function of energy. Our one-dimensional square well potential does not provide a good quantitative match for the data, but it illustrates the physical phenomenon. A three-dimensional spherical square well is needed for a quantitative analysis.\n",

At the arrow, we have $R = 0$, so there is no scattering. All of the electrons go straight through the noble gas atoms! They experience resonant transmission. This first occurs around $1 \\mathop{eV}$.\n",
