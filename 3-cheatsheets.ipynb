    "## 3.1 Photoelectric Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "### The photoelectric effect was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. When polished metal plates are irradiated, he observed, they may emit electrons, then called “photo-electrons”. The emitted electrons thus produce a **photoelectric current**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The key observations were:\n",
    "- ### There is a threshold frequency $\\nu_0$. Only for frequencies $\\nu > \\nu_0$ is there a photoelectric current. The frequency $\\nu_0$ depends on the metal and the configuration of the atoms at the surface. It is also affected by inhomogeneities.\n",
    "- ### The magnitude of the photoelectric current is proportional to the intensity of the light source.\n",
    "- ### Energy of the photoelectrons is **independent** of the intensity of the light source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A natural explanation for the features in this effect didn’t come until 1905, when Einstein explained the above features by postulating that the energy in light is carried by discrete quanta (later called photons) with energy $h\\nu$. Here $h$ is Planck’s constant, the constant used by Planck to produce a fit for the blackbody energy as a function of frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 1: Electrons in a metal are bound. If the photon energy is greater than the work function $W$ an electron may be ejected.\n",
    "![img](img/img-3-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A given material has a characteristic energy $W$, called the **work function**, which is the minimum energy required to eject an electron. This is not easily calculated because it is the result of an interaction of many electrons with the background of atoms. It is easily measured, however. When the surface of the material is irradiated, electrons in the material absorb the energy of the incoming photons. If the energy imparted on an electron by the absorption of a single photon is greater than the work function $W$, then the electron is ejected with kinetic energy $E_{e^-}$ equal to the difference of the photon energy and the work function:\n",
    "## $$ E_{e^-} = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = h\\nu-W = E_{\\gamma} - W \\quad (1.1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### This equation, written by Einstein explains the experimental features noted above, once we assume that the quanta act on individual electrons to eject them. The threshold frequency is defined by\n",
    "## $$ h\\nu_0 = W \\quad (1.2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### as it leads to a photoelectron with zero energy. For $\\nu > \\nu_0$ the electrons will be ejected. Increasing the intensity of the light source increases the rate that photons arrive, which will increase the magnitude of the current, but will not change the energy of the photoelectrons because it does not change the energy of each incoming quanta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation (1.2) allowed Einstein to make a prediction: The kinetic energy of the photo-electrons increases linearly with the frequency of light. Einstein’s prediction was confirmed experimentally by Millikan (1915) who measured carefully the photoelectron energies and confirmed their linear dependence on the energy. Millikan’s careful work allowed him to determine the value of Planck’s constant $\\hbar$ to better than $1\\%$ accuracy! Still, skepticism remained and physicists were not yet convinced about the particle nature of these light quanta.\n",

    "### **Example**:\n",
    "### Consider UV light with wavelength $\\lambda = 290\\mathop{nm}$ incident on a metal with work function $W = 4.05eV$. What is the energy of the photo-electron and what is its speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Solution**:\n",
    "### It is useful to solve these problems without having to look up constants. For this try recalling this useful relation\n",
    "## $$ \\hbar c = 197.333 \\mathop{MeV}.\\mathop{fm}, \\quad \\hbar \\equiv \\frac{h}{2\\pi} \\quad (1.3) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### and thus\n",
    "## $$ E_{e^-} = E_{\\gamma} - W = 0.23 \\mathop{eV}. \\quad (1.5) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "### Recalling that $m_e c^2 \\simeq 511,000\\mathop{eV}$ one finds\n",

    "\n",
    "### This is a good point to consider units, in particular the units of $h$. We can ask: Is there a physical quantity that has the units of $h$. The answer is yes, as we will see now. From the equation $E = h\\nu$, we have\n",

    "### where $[\\cdot]$ gives the units of a quantity, and $M, L, T$ are units of mass, length, and time, respectively. We have written the right-most expression as a product of units of length and momentum. Therefore\n",

    "\n",
    "### We see that $h$ has units of angular momentum! Indeed for a spin one-half particle, the magnitude of the spin angular momentum is $\\displaystyle  \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With $[h] = [r][p]$ we also see that one has a canonical way to associate a length to any particle of a given mass $m$. Indeed, using the speed of light, we can construct the momentum $p = mc$, and then the length $f$ is obtained from the ratio $h/p$. This actually is the **Compton wavelength** $\\lambda_C$ of a particle:\n",

The de Broglie wavelength of the particle uses the true momentum of the particle, not $mc$! Thus, Compton and de Broglie wavelengths should not be confused!\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is possible to get some physical intuition for the Compton wavelength $\\lambda_C$ of a particle. We claim that $\\lambda_C$ **is the wavelength of a photon whose energy is equal to the rest energy of the particle**. Indeed we would have\n",

If you use light, the possible accuracy in the position of the particle is roughly the wavelength of the light. Once we use light with $\\lambda < \\lambda_C$ the photons carry more energy than the rest energy of the particle. It is possible then that the energy of the photons go into creating more particles of mass $m$, making it difficult, if not impossible to localize the particle. The Compton wavelength is the length scale at which we need **relativistic quantum field theory** to take into account the possible processes of particle creation and annihilation.\n",

    "\n",
    "### This length is about 20 times smaller than the Bohr radius ($53 \\mathop{pm}$) and about two-thousand times the size of a proton ($1 \\mathop{fm}$). The Compton wavelength of the electron appears in the formula for the change of photon wavelength in the process called Compton scattering."

    "### Originally Einstein did not make clear that the light quantum meant a particle of light.

The peak at $\\lambda_i$ represents a process in which an electron receives some momentum from the photon but still remains bound. This is not very unlikely: the typical momentum of a bound electron is actually comparable to the momentum of the photon. In this case the photon scatters at $90^\\circ$ and the recoil momentum is carried by the whole atom. The relevant Compton wavelength is therefore that of the atom. Since the mass of the carbon atom is several thousands of times larger than the mass of the electron, the Compton wavelength of the atom is much smaller than the electron Compton wavelength and there should be no detectable change in the wavelength of the photon."

    "### As we have seen, light behaves as both a particle and a wave. This kind of behavior is usually said to be a duality: the complete reality of the object is captured using both the wave and particle features of the object. The photon is a particle of energy $E_\\gamma$, but has frequency $\\nu$ which is a wave attribute, with $E = h\\nu$. It is a particle with momentum $p_\\gamma$ but it also has a wavelength $\\lambda$, a wave attribute, given by $(2.16)$\n",

And exciting consequence of this is that matter particles can diffract or interfere! In the famous Davisson-Germer experiment (1927) electrons are struck off a metal surface and one finds that at certain angles there are peaks in the intensity of the scattered electrons. The peaks showed the effect of constructive interference from scattering off the lattice of atoms in the metal, demonstrating the wave nature of the electrons. One can also do two-slit interference with electrons, and the experiment can be done shooting one electron at a time. A recent experiment [arXiv:1310.8343](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.8343.pdf) by Eibenberger et.al reports interference using molecules with 810 atoms and mass exceeding $10 000 \\mathop{amu}$ (that’s 20 million times the mass of the electron!)\n",
