    "\n",
    "### Schrodinger thought that the wavefunction $\\Psi$ represents a particle that could spread out and disintegrate. The fraction of the particle to be found at $x$ would be proportional to the magnitude of $|\\Psi|^2$. This was problematic, as noted by Max Born (1882-1970). Born solved the Schrodinger equation for scattering of a particle in a potential, finding a wavefunction that fell like $1/r$, with $r$ the distance to the scattering center. But Born also noticed that in the experiment one does not find fractions of particles going in many directions but rather particles remain whole. Born suggested a probabilistic interpretation. In his proposal, \n",
