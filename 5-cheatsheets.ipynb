The same for eigenstates of operators: an operator acting on an eigenstate gives the eigenstate up to a multiplicative constant. We also say that $\\Psi$ is a state of **definite momentum**.\n",

Note that, if we were to write xˆ and pˆ operators in matrix form, they would require infinite dimensional matrices. One can show that there are no finite size matrices that commute to give a number times the identity matrix, as is required from (2.13).

If we know ?(x, t0) for all x then the right-hand side of the Schro¨dinger equa- tion, which just involves x derivatives and multiplication, can be evaluated at any point x.

    "Schro¨dinger thought that the wavefunction ? represents a particle that could spread out and disintegrate. The fraction of the particle to be found at x would be proportional to the mag- nitude of |?|2. This was problematic, as noted by Max Born (1882-1970). Born solved the Schro¨dinger equation for scattering of a particle in a potential, finding a wavefunction that fell like 1/r, with r the distance to the scattering center. But Born also noticed that in the experiment one does not find fractions of particles going in many directions but rather particles remain whole. Born suggested a probabilistic interpretation. In his proposal,\n",
