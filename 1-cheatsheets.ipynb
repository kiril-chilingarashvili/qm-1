    "### Quantum mechanics is now almost one-hundred years old, but we are still discovering some of its surprising features and it remains the subject of much investigation and speculation. The framework of quantum mechanics is a rich and elegant extension of the framework of classical physics. It is also counterintuitive and almost paradoxical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum physics has replaced classical physics as the correct fundamental description of our physიcal universe. It is used routinely to describe most phenomena that occur at short distances. Quantum physics is the result of applying the framework of quantum mechanics to different physical phenomena. We thus have Quantum Electrodynamics, when quantum mechanics is applied to electromagnetism, Quantum Optics, when it is applied to light and optical devices, or Quantum Gravity, when it is applied to gravitation. Quantum mechanics indeed provides a remarkably coherent and elegant framework. The era of quantum physics begins in 1925, with the discoveries of Schrodinger and Heisenberg. The seeds for these discoveries were planted by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, and others. It is a tribute to human imagination that we have been able to discover the counterintuitive and abstract set of rules that define quantum mechanics. Here we aim to explain and provide some perspective on the main features of this framework.\n",
    "### We will begin by discussing the property of linearity, which quantum mechanics shares with elec- tromagnetic theory. This property tells us what kind of theory quantum mechanics is and why, it could be argued, it is simpler than classical mechanics. We then turn to photons, the particles of light. We use photons and polarizers to explain why quantum physics is not deterministic and, in contrast with classical physics, the results of some experiments cannot be predicted. Quantum mechanics is a framework in which we can only predict the probabilities for the various outcomes of any given experiment. Our next subject is quantum superpositions, in which a quantum object somehow manages to exist simultaneously in two mutually incompatible states. A quantum light-bulb, for example, could be in a state in which it is both on and off at the same time!\n"

    "## Linearity of the equations of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "### In physics a theory is usually described by a set of equations for some quantities called the **dynamical variables** of the theory. After writing a theory, the most important task is finding solutions of the equations. A solution of the equations describes a possible reality, according to the theory. Because an expanding universe is a solution of Albert Einstein’s gravitational equations, for example, it follows that an expanding universe is possible, according to this theory. A single theory may have many solutions, each describing a possible reality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### There are linear theories and nonlinear theories. Nonlinear theories are more complex than linear theories. In a linear theory a remarkable fact takes place: if you have two solutions you obtain a third solution of the theory simply by adding the two solutions. An example of a beautiful linear theory is Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, a theory that governs the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. A field, as you probably know, is a quantity whose values may depend on position and on time. A simple solution of this theory describes an electromagnetic wave propagating in a given direction. Another simple solution could describe an electromagnetic wave propagating in a different direction. Because the theory is linear, having the two waves propagating simultaneously, each in its own direction and without affecting each other, is a new and consistent solution. The sum is a solution in the sense that the electric field in the new solution is the sum of the electric field in the first solution plus the electric field in the second solution. The same goes for the magnetic field: the magnetic field in the new solution is the sum of the magnetic field in the first solution plus the magnetic field in the second solution. In fact you can add any number of solutions to still find a solution. Even if this sounds esoteric, you are totally familiar with it. The air around you is full of electromagnetic waves, each one propagating oblivious to the other ones. There are the waves of thousands of cell phones, the waves carrying hundreds of wireless internet messages, the waves from a plethora of radio-stations, TV stations, and many, many more. Today, a single transatlantic cable can carry simultaneously millions of telephone calls, together with huge amounts video and internet data. All of that courtesy of linearity.\n",

    "### More concretely, we say that Maxwell’s equations are linear equations. A solution of Maxwell’s equation is described by an electric field $E$ a magnetic field $B$, a charge density $\\rho$ and a current density $J$, all collectively denoted as $(E, B, \\rho, J)$. This collection of fields and sources satisfy Maxwell’s equations.

The signature equation in this theory, the so-called Schrodinger equation is a linear equation for a quantity called the **wavefunction** and it determines its time evolution. The wavefunction is the dynamical variable in quantum mechanics but, curiously, its physical interpretation was not clear to Erwin Schrodinger when he wrote the equation in 1925. It was Max Born, who months later suggested that the wavefunction encodes probabilities. This was the correct physical interpretation, but it was thoroughly disliked by many, including Schrodinger, who remained unhappy about it for the rest of his life.

    "## 1.2 Complex Numbers are Essential\n",
    "### Quantum mechanics is the first physics theory that truly makes use of **complex** numbers. The numbers most of us use for daily life (integers, fractions, decimals) are **real** numbers. The set of complex numbers is denoted by $\\mathbb{C}$ and the set of real numbers is denoted by $\\mathbb{R}$. Complex numbers appear when we combine real numbers with the imaginary unit $i$, defined to be equal to the square root of minus one: $i\\equiv \\sqrt{-1}$. Being the square root of minus one, it means that $i$ squared must give minus one: $i^2 = -1$. Complex numbers are fundamental in mathematics. An equation like $x^2 = -4$, for an unknown $x$ cannot be solved if $x$ has to be real. No real number squared gives you minus one. But if we allow for complex numbers, we have the solutions $x = \\pm 2i$. Mathematicians have shown that all polynomial equations can be solved in terms of complex numbers.\n",

If you consider the unit length vector in the complex plane making an angle $\\theta$ with the $x$ axis has $x$ component $\\cos(\\theta)$ and $y$ component $\\sin(\\theta)$.

    "## 1.3 Loss of Determinism\n",
    "### Maxwell’s crowning achievement was the realization that his equations of electromagnetism allowed for the existence of propagating waves. In particular, in 1865 he conjectured that light was an electromagnetic wave, a propagating fluctuation of electric and magnetic fields. He was proven right in subsequent experiments. Towards the end of the nineteenth century physicists were convinced that light was a wave. The certainty, however, did not last too long. Experiments on blackbody radiation and on the photo-emission of electrons suggested that the behavior of light had to be more complicated than that of a simple wave. Max Planck and Albert Einstein were the most prominent contributors to the resolution of the puzzles raised by those experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In order to explain the features of the photoelectric effect, Einstein postulated (1905) that in a light beam the energy comes in quanta – the beam is composed of packets of energy. Einstein essentially implied that light was made up of particles, each carrying a fixed amount of energy. He himself found this idea disturbing, convinced like most other contemporaries that, as Maxwell had shown, light was a wave. He anticipated that a physical entity, like light, that could behave both as a particle and as a wave could bring about the demise of classical physics and would require a completely new physical theory. He was in fact right. Though he never quite liked quantum mechanics, his ideas about particles of light, later given the name **photons**, helped construct this theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It took physicists until 1925 to accept that light could behave like a particle. The experiments of Arthur Compton (1923) eventually convinced most skeptics. Nowadays, particles of light, or photons, are routinely manipulated in laboratories around the world. Even if mysterious, we have grown accustomed to them. Each photon of visible light carries very little energy – a small laser pulse can contain many billions of photons. Our eye, however, is a very good photon detector: in total darkness, we are able to see light when as little as ten photons hit upon our retina. When we say that light behaves like a particle we mean a quantum mechanical particle: a packet of energy and momentum that is not composed of smaller packets. We do not mean a classical point particle or Newtonian corpuscle, which is a zero-size object with definite position and velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As it turns out, the energy of a photon depends only on the color of the light. As Einstein discovered the energy $E$ and frequency $\\nu$ for a photon are related by\n",
    "## $$ E = h\\nu \\quad\t(3.1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The frequency of a photon determines the wavelength $\\lambda$ of the light through the relation $\\nu \\lambda = c$, where $c$ is the speed of light. All green photons, for example, have the same energy. To increase the energy in a light beam while keeping the same color, one simply needs more photons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As we now explain, the existence of photons implies that Quantum Mechanics is not deterministic. By this we mean that the result of an experiment cannot be determined, as it would in classical physics, by the conditions that are under the control of the experimenter.\n",

Thus light linearly polarized in the $\\hat{\\vec{y}}$ direction will be totally absorbed by the polarizer.

This means that the fraction of the beam’s energy that goes through the polarizer is $(cos (\\alpha))^2$. It is also well known that the light emerging from the polarizer has the **same frequency** as the incident light.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So far so good. But now, let us try to understand this result by thinking about the photons that make up the incident light. The premise here is that all photons in the incident beam are identical. Moreover the photons do not interact with each other. We could even imagine sending the whole energy of the incident light beam one photon at a time. Since all the light that emerges from the polarizer has the same frequency as the incident light, and thus the same frequency, we must conclude that each individual photon either goes through or is absorbed. If a fraction of a photon went through it would be a photon of lower energy and thus lower frequency, which is something that does not happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But now we have a problem. As we know from the wave analysis, roughly a fraction $(cos(\\alpha))^2$ of the photons must go through, since that is the fraction of the energy that is transmitted. Consequently a fraction $1-(\\cos(\\alpha))^2$ of the photons must be absorbed. But if all the photons are identical, why is it that what happens to one photon does not happen to all of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The answer in quantum mechanics is that there is indeed a loss of determinism. No one can predict if a photon will go through or will get absorbed. The best anyone can do is to predict probabilities. In this case there would be a probability $(cos(\\alpha))^2$ of going through and a probability $1-(\\cos(\\alpha))^2$ of failing to go through.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two escape routes suggest themselves. Perhaps the polarizer is not really a homogeneous object and depending exactly on where the photon his it either gets absorbed or goes through. Experiments show this is not the case. A more intriguing possibility was suggested by Einstein and others. A possible way out, they claimed, was the existence of hidden variables. The photons, while apparently identical, would have other hidden properties, not currently understood, that would determine with certainty which photon goes through and which photon gets absorbed. Hidden variable theories would seem to be untestable, but surprisingly they can be tested. Through the work of John Bell and others, physicists have devised clever experiments that rule out most versions of hidden variable theories. No one has figured out how to restore determinism to quantum mechanics. It seems to be an impossible task.\n",

    "### We have already discussed the concept of linearity; the idea that the sum of two solutions representing physical realities represents a new, allowed, physical reality. This superposition of solutions has a straightforward meaning in classical physics. In the case of electromagnetism, for example, if we have two solutions, each with its own electric and magnetic field, the “sum” solution is simply understood: its electric field is the sum of the electric fields of the two solutions and its magnetic field is the sum of the magnetic fields of the two solutions. In quantum mechanics, as we have explained, linearity holds. The interpretation of a superposition, however, is very surprising.\n",

    "### Figure 4: A Mach-Zehnder interferometer consists of two beam splitters BS1 and BS2, two mirrors M1 and M2, and two detectors D0 and D1. An incident beam will be split into two beams by BS1. One beam goes through the upper branch, which contains M1, the other beam goes through the lower branch, which contains M2. The beams on the two branches recombine at BS2 and are then sent into the detectors. The configuration is prepared to produce an interference so that all incident photons end at the detector D0, with none at D1.\n",

    "### The Mach-Zehnder configuration, shown in Figure 4, has a left beam splitter (BS1) and a right beam splitter (BS2). In between we have the two mirrors, M1 on the top and M2 on the bottom. An incoming beam from the left is split by BS1 into two beams, each of which hits a mirror and is then sent into BS2. At BS2 the beams are recombined and sent into two outgoing beams that go into photon detectors D0 and D1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is relatively simple to arrange the beam-splitters so that the incoming beam, upon splitting at BS1 and recombination at BS2 emerges in the top beam which goes into D0. In this arrangement no light at all goes into D1. This requires a precise interference effect at BS2. Note that we have two beams incident upon BS2; the top beam is called ‘a’ and the lower beam is called ‘b’. Two contributions go towards D0: the reflection of ‘a’ at BS2 and the transmission from ‘b’ at BS2. These two contributions interfere constructively to give a beam going into D0. Two contributions also go towards D1: the transmission from ‘a’ at BS2 and the reflection from ‘b’ at BS2. These two can indeed be arranged to interfere destructively to give no beam going into D1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is instructive to think of the incoming beam as a sequence of photons that we send into the interferometer, one photon at a time. This shows that, at the level of photons, the interference is not interference of one photon with another photon. Each photon must interfere with itself to give the result. Indeed interference between two photons is not possible: destructive interference, for example, would require that two photons end up giving no photon, which is impossible by energy conservation. Therefore, each photon does the very strange thing of going through both branches of the interferometer! Each photon is in a superposition of two states: a state in which the photon is in the top beam or upper branch, added to a state in which the photon is in the bottom beam or lower branch. \n",

    "### Thus the state of the photon in the interferometer is a funny state in which the photon seems to be doing two incompatible things at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation $(3.6)$ is another example of a quantum superposition. The photon state has a component along an $x$-polarized photon and a component along a $y$-polarized photon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When we speak of a wavefunction, we also sometimes call it a state, because the wavefunction specifies the “state” of our quantum system. We also sometimes refer to states as vectors. A quantum state may not be a vector like the familiar vectors in three-dimensional space but it is a vector nonetheless because it makes sense to add states and to multiply states by numbers. Just like vectors can be added, linearity guarantees that adding wavefunctions or states is a sensible thing to do. Just like any vector can be written as a sum of other vectors in many different ways, we will do the same with our states. By writing our physical state as sums of other states we can learn about the properties of our state.\n",
