    "### This potential, shown to the left in Figure 1, has a number of bound states, all of which are non-degenerate and can be counted. There is also a set of positive energy eigenstates: the scattering states that, belonging to a continuum, cannot be counted. Our proof requires the possibility of counting states, so we will introduce a second infinite wall, placed at $x = L$ for large $L$. Of course, this will change the spectrum, but as $L$ becomes larger and larger the changes will become smaller and smaller. We think of $L$ as a regulator for the potential that discretizes the spectrum and thus enables us to enumerate the states. It does so because with two walls, the potential becomes a wide infinite well and all states become bound states. The potential with the regulator wall is shown to the right in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The key of the proof will be to compare the counting of states in the regulated $V \\neq 0$ potential to the counting of states in the $V = 0$ potential, also regulated with a second wall at $x = L$. Consider therefore the regulated $V = 0$ potential and the positive energy eigenstates. These correspond to the wavefunction $\\phi(x) = \\sin(kx)$, with the second wall requiring $\\phi(x = L) = 0$. \n",

If the time delay is negative, the reflected wavepacket emerges ahead of time. We can ask: Can we get an arbitrarily large **negative** time delay? The answer is no. A very large time delay would be a violation of causality. It would mean that the incoming packet is reflected even before it reaches $x = R$, which is impossible. In fact, the largest negative time delay would be realized (at least classically) if we had perfect **reflection** when the incoming packet hits $x = R$.
