What this means is that $\\displaystyle \\Psi = e^{ikx-i\\omega t}$ does not truly represent a single particle. To construct a square-integrable wavefunction we can use a superposition of plane waves. It is indeed a pleasant surprise that the superposition of infinitely many non-square integrable waves is square integrable!"
