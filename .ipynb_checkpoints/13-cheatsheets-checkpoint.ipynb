    "## 13.1 The Delta Function Potential\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a one-dimensional potential. The potential $V(x)$ is rather singular: it vanishes for all $x$ except for $x = 0$ at which point it has infinite strength. More precisely, the potential is delta function localized at $x = 0$ and is written as\n",
    "## $$ V(x) = -\\alpha \\delta(x), \\quad \\alpha > 0 \\quad (1.1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here $\\alpha$ is a constant chosen to be positive. Because of the explicit minus sign, the potential is infinitely negative at $x = 0$; the potential is attractive. The potential is shown in Fig. 1, where we represent the delta function by an arrow pointing downwards.\n",

    "### We want to know if this potential admits bound states. For a bound state the energy $E$ must be negative: this ensures that all of $x \\neq 0$ is classically forbidden, and the wavefunction will decay rapidly allowing a normalized solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### A bit of intuition comes by thinking of the delta function as approximated by a finite square well in the limit as the width of the well goes to zero and the depth goes to infinity in such a way that the product, representing the ”area” is finite (the delta function is a function with unit area, as it is clear from its integral). \n",

    "### In Figure 2 we show two finite-well representations and sketch the wavefunction. \n",

    "### We can see that the middle region provides the curving of the wavefunction needed to have a smooth derivative. In the limit as the width of the region goes to zero we would expect, if there is a bound state, to have **discontinuous derivative**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We can get further insight by considering units. The dimension-full constants in the problem are $\\alpha$, $m$, and $\\hbar$. Since a delta function has units of one over length, the constant $\\alpha$ must have units of energy times length for the potential to have units of energy. \n",

This potential has a number of bound states (energy eigenstates that satisfy $\\psi \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$), which we index $\\psi_1, \\psi_2, \\psi_3, \\ldots$. Recall also that there are no degenerate bound states in one dimension. The node theorem states that $\\psi_n$ has $n - 1$ nodes. We will give an intuitive, non-rigorous explanation of this phenomenon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For this argument we also recall that $\\psi(x_0) = \\psi'(x_0) = 0$ implies that $\\psi(x) = 0$ for all x. One cannot have vanishing derivative at a zero of the wavefunction. That applies to nodes or finite endpoints.\n",

    "### As shown in Fig. 4, the screened potential $V_a(x)$ is an infinite well of width $2a$ whose bottom is taken from $V(x)$. The argument below is based on two plausible assumptions. First: As $a \\to \\infty$ the bound states of $V_a(x)$ become the bound states of $V(x)$. Second: As $a$ is increased the wavefunction and its derivative are continuously stretched and deformed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When $a$ is very small, $V_a(x)$ is approximately a very narrow infinite well with a flat bottom – an infinite **square** well. This is because we chose $x = 0$ to be a minimum and any minimum is locally flat. On this infinite square well the node theorem holds. The ground state, for example, will vanish at the endpoints and will have no nodes. We will now argue that as the screen is enlarged we can’t generate a node. This applies to the ground state, as we explicitly discuss below, and to all other states too. If we can’t generate nodes by screen enlargement the node theorem applies to $V(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this the case? Consider how we might develop an additional node while stretching the screen. To start with, consider the ground state in the top part of Figure 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 5: Introducing a single node requires changing the sign of the derivative at the right endpoint: $\\psi'(a) < 0$ but $\\psi'(a')>0$. At some intermediate screen, the value of $\\psi'$ at the right endpoint must become zero. But this is impossible.\n",
    "![img](img/img-13-05.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### There is no node at this value of the screen and we have $\\psi'(-a) > 0$ (left wall) and $\\psi'(a) < 0$ (right wall). Suppose that as we increase $a$ we produce a node, shown for the larger screen $a'$ below. For this to happen the sign of $\\psi'$ at one of the endpoints must change. In the case shown it is the right endpoint that experiences a change in the sign of $\\psi'$. With the assumption of continuous stretching there would have to be some intermediate screen at which $\\psi' = 0$ at the right endpoint. But in that case, $\\psi = \\psi' = 0$ at this endpoint, and then $\\psi(x) = 0$ for all $x$, which is clearly impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 6: Introducing two nodes by having the wavefunction cross the $x$-axis in between the two boundaries (compare top and bottom). This is not possible as it would require in an intermediate screen (middle) in which $\\psi = \\psi' = 0$ at some point.\n",
    "![img](img/img-13-06.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### It is possible to introduce nodes without changing the sign of $\\psi'$ at either endpoint. In this process, shown in Fig. 6, the wavefunction dips and produces two new nodes. This process can’t take place, however. Indeed, for some intermediate screen the wavefunction must be tangential to the $x$ axis and at this point we will have $\\psi=\\psi'=0$, which is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We conclude that we cannot change the number of nodes of any wavefunction as we stretch the screen. The $n$-th excited state of the tiny infinite square well, with $n-1$ nodes will turn into the $n$-th excited state of $V(x)$ with $n - 1$ nodes. In the tiny infinite square well the energy levels are ordered in increasing energy by the number of nodes. The same is true at all stages of the stretching screen and therefore for true for $V(x)$. Any two consecutive energy levels cannot get permuted because, by continuity, this would require a situation where we have a degeneracy, which is not possible."
