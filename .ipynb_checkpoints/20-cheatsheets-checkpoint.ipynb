    "We have so far considered a number of Hermitian operators: the position operator, the momentum operator, and the energy operator, or the Hamiltonian. These operators are observables and their eigenvalues are the possible results of measuring them on states. We will be discussing here another operator: angular momentum. It is a vector operator, just like momentum. It will lead to three components, each of which is a Hermitian operator, and thus a measurable quantity. The definition of the angular momentum operator, as you will see, arises from the classical mechanics counterpart. The properties of the operator, however, will be rather new and surprising.\n",
    "   You may have noticed that the momentum operator has something to do with translations. Indeed the momentum operator is a derivative in coordinate space and derivatives are related to translations. The precise way in which this happens is through exponentiation. Consider a suitable exponential of the momentum operator:\n",
