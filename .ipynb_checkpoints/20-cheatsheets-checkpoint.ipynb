    "## 20.1 Schrodinger Equation in 3D and Angular Momentum\n",
    "\n",
    "### We have so far considered a number of Hermitian operators: the position operator, the momentum operator, and the energy operator, or the Hamiltonian. These operators are observables and their eigenvalues are the possible results of measuring them on states. We will be discussing here another operator: angular momentum. It is a vector operator, just like momentum. It will lead to three components, each of which is a Hermitian operator, and thus a measurable quantity. The definition of the angular momentum operator, as you will see, arises from the classical mechanics counterpart. The properties of the operator, however, will be rather new and surprising.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You may have noticed that the momentum operator has something to do with translations. Indeed the momentum operator is a derivative in coordinate space and derivatives are related to translations. The precise way in which this happens is through exponentiation. Consider a suitable exponential of the momentum operator:\n",
    "## $$ e^{\\displaystyle \\frac{i\\hat{p}a}{\\hbar}} \\quad (1.1) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### where $a$ is a constant with units of length, making the argument of the exponential unit free. Consider now letting this operator act on a wavefunction $\\psi(x)$\n",
    "## $$ e^{\\frac{i\\hat{p}a}{\\hbar}}\\psi(x) = e^{a \\frac{d}{dx}}\\psi(x) \\quad(1.2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### where we simplified the exponent. Expanding the exponential gives\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} \\displaystyle e^{\\frac{i\\hat{p}a}{\\hbar}} \\psi(x) & = & \\displaystyle \\left( 1 + a\\frac{d}{dx} + \\frac{a^2}{2!}\\frac{d^2}{dx^2} + \\frac{a^3}{3!}\\frac{d^3}{dx^3}+\\cdots \\right)\\psi(x) \\\\ \\, & = & \\displaystyle \\psi(x) + a\\frac{d\\psi(x)}{dx} + \\frac{a^2}{2!}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + \\frac{a^3}{3!}\\frac{d^3\\psi(x)}{dx^3}+\\cdots \\\\ \\, & = & \\psi(x+a) \\end{array} \\quad (1.3) $$\n",

    "### since we recognize the familiar Taylor expansion. \n",
    "\n",
    "### This result means that the operator $\\displaystyle e^{\\frac{i\\hat{p}a}{\\hbar}}$ moves the wavefunction. In fact it moves it a distance $-a$, since $\\psi(x + a)$ is the displacement of $\\psi(x)$ by a distance $-a$. We say that the momentum operator generates translations. Similarly, we will be able to show that the angular momentum operator generates rotations. Again, this means that suitable exponentials of the angular momentum operator acting on wavefunctions will rotate them in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Angular momentum can be of the orbital type, this is the familiar case that occurs when a particle rotates around some fixed point. But is can also be **spin** angular momentum. This is a rather different kind of angular momentum and can be carried by point particles. Much of the mathematics of angular momentum is valid both for orbital and spin angular momentum.\n",
