    "## 11.1 The Infinite Square Well\n",
    "\n",
    "### In our last lecture we examined the quantum wavefunction of a particle moving in a circle. Here we introduce another instructive toy model, the **infinite square well potential**. This forces a particle to live on an interval of the real line, the interval conventionally chosen to be $x \\in [0, a]$. At the ends $0$ and $a$ of the interval there are hard walls that prevent the particle from going to $x > a$ and $x < 0$.\n",

    "### It is reasonable to assume that the wavefunction must vanish in the region where the potential is infinite. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classically any region where the potential exceeds the energy of the particle is forbidden. Not so in quantum mechanics. But even in quantum mechanics a particle can’t be in a region of infinite potential. We will be able to justify these claims by studying the more complicated finite square well in the limit as the height of the potential goes to infinity. \n",

    "### These are our boundary conditions. You may wonder about the continuity of the first derivative $\\psi'(x)$. This derivative vanishes outside the interval and continuity would say that $\\psi'$ should vanish at $0$ and at $a$. But this is impossible. A solution of Schrodinger’s equation (a second order differential equation) for which both the wavefunction and its derivative vanishes at a point is identically zero! If a solution exist we must accept that $\\psi'$ can have discontinuities at an infinite wall. Therefore we do not impose any boundary condition on $\\psi'$. The two conditions above will suffice to find a solution. In that solution $\\psi'$ is discontinuous at the endpoints.\n",

    "### We note a few features:\n",
    "\n",
    "### *1.* The ground state $n = 1$ has no nodes. A node is a zero of the wavefunction that is not at the ends of the domain of the wavefunction. The zeroes at $x = 0$ and $x = a$ do not count as nodes. Clearly $\\psi_1(x)$ does not vanish anywhere in the interior of $[0, a]$ and therefore it has no nodes. It is in fact true that any normalizable ground state of a one-dimensional potential does not have nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *2.* The first excited state, $n = 2$ has one node. It is at $\\displaystyle x = \\frac{a}{2}$, the midpoint of the interval. The second excited state, $n = 3$ has two nodes. The pattern in fact continues. The $n$-th excited state will have $n$ nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *3.* In the figure the dotted vertical line marks the interval midpoint $\\displaystyle x = \\frac{a}{2}$. We note that the ground state is symmetric under reflection about $\\displaystyle x = \\frac{a}{2}$. The first excited state is antisymmetric, indeed its node is at $\\displaystyle x = \\frac{a}{2}$. The second excited state is again symmetric. Symmetry and antisymmetry alternate forever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *4.* The symmetry just noted is not accidental. It holds, in general for potentials $V(x)$ that are even functions of $x$: $V(-x) = V(x)$. Our potential, does not satisfy this equation, but this could have been changed easily and with no consequence. We could shift the well over so that rather than having $V(x) = 0$ from $0 \\leq x \\leq a$, it extends from $\\displaystyle -\\frac{a}{2} \\leq x \\leq \\frac{a}{2}$ and then it would be symmetric about the origin $x = 0$ (see figure 3). \n",

    "### Figure 3: The infinite square well shifted to the left to make it symmetric about the origin.\n",
    "![img](img/img-11-03.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will later prove that the bound states of a one-dimensional even potential are either even or odd! Here we are just seeing an example of such result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *5.* The wavefunctions $\\psi_n(x)$ with $n = 1, 2, \\ldots$ form a complete set that can be used to expand any function in the interval $x \\in [0, a]$ that vanishes at the endpoints. If the function does not vanish at the endpoints, the convergence of the expansion is delicate, and physically such wavefunction would be problematic as one can verify that the expectation value of the energy is infinite."

    "### In figure 6 the curve $\\xi = -\\eta \\cot(\\eta)$ does not appear for $\\eta < \\pi/2$ because $\\xi$ is then negative. For $z_0 < \\pi$ there are no odd bound-state solutions, but we still have the even bound state.\n",

    "### We could have anticipated the quantization of the energy by the following argument. Suppose you try to calculate energy eigenstates which, as far as solving the Schrodinger equation, are determined up to an overall normalization. Suppose you don’t know the energy is quantized and you fix some arbitrary fixed energy and calculate. Both in the even and in the odd case, we can set the coefficient of the $\\sin(kx)$ or $\\cos(kx)$ function inside the well equal to one. The coefficient of the decaying exponential outside the well was undetermined, we called it $A$. Therefore we just have one unknown, $A$. But we have two equations, because we impose continuity of $\\psi$ and of $\\psi'$ at $x = a$. If we have one unknown and two equations, we have no reason to believe there is a solution. Indeed, generally there is none. But then, if we think of the energy $E$ as an unknown, that energy appears at various places in the equations (in $k$ and $\\kappa$) and therefore having two unknowns $A$ and $E$ and two equations, we should expect a single solution! This is indeed what happened.\n",

    "### In figure 7 we sketch the energy eigenstates of a square-well potential with three bound states of energies $E_1 < E_2 < E_3$. A few features of the wavefunctions are manifest: they alternate as even, odd, and even. They have zero, one, and two nodes, respectively. The second derivative of $\\psi$ is negative for $|x| < a$ and positive for $|x| > a$ (it is in fact discontinuous at $x = \\pm a$). The exponential decay in the region $|x| > a$ is fastest for the ground state and slowest for the least bound state."
