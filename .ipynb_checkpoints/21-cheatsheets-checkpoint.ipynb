    "Our goal here is to show that the two-body quantum mechanical problem of the hydrogen atom can be recast as one in which we have center-of-mass degrees of freedom that behave like a free particle and relative-motion degrees of freedom for which we have dynamics controlled by a central potential. The hydrogen atom consists of a proton and an electron moving in three dimensions. We label the position and momentum operators of the proton as xˆp, pˆp, and those of the electron as xˆe, pˆe. These\n",
