In our first example, shown in Figure 2, the potential $V$ is constant and the energy $E$ is greater than $V$. A particle in such a potential will have a constant potential energy $K$ and thus a constant momentum $p = \\sqrt{2mK}$.

    "### Figure 11: An even potential (top figure) and the result of integrating the equation from $x = \\infty$ towards zero for various values of the energy. We get a solution when $\\psi(x)$ for $x \\geq 0$ can be matched with continuous $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ to an even or odd extension valid for $x < 0$. There is no solution for $E_1$ and $E_3$. The ground state arises for $E_2$ and the first excited state arises for $E_4$.\n",

    "### Consider, for example, the integration of the equation for $E = E_1$. Coming in from $x = \\infty$ the solution has an inflection point and becomes concave towards the axis. Beyond this point the first derivative $\\psi'$ decreases. Still, as shown in the picture $\\psi'$ does not vanish at $x = 0$, so that the even extension for $x < 0$ does not match properly with the $x > 0$ solution at $x = 0$, because $\\psi'$ fails to be continuous. Matching with the odd extension is not a possibility because then $\\psi$ would fail to be continuous at $x = 0$. Thus $E_1$ is not an allowed energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As we increase the energy to $E = E_2$, the turning point occurs for larger $x$ and $\\psi'$ manages to get exactly to zero at $x = 0$, matching $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ from the even extension. This time we have a solution. Of course this occurs for $E = E_2$ precisely; a bit more energy or a bit less energy and the derivative is not continuous at $x = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As we increase the energy to $E_3$ the turning point moves to even larger $x$ and $\\psi'$ is negative by the time we get to $x = 0$, while $\\psi$ is still positive. The solution can’t be matched with the even extension because of the discontinuous derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If we now increase the energy further to some value $E_4$, by the time we reach $x = 0$ the derivative $\\psi'$ will be negative and $\\psi$ will be exactly zero. As you can see in the figure, we can get a good match to the odd extension for $x < 0$. This is the first excited state. It is an odd wavefunction with a single node at $x = 0$."

    "## 12.4 Shooting Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### The **shooting method** is a numerical method to find the form of bound-state solution to the the Schrodinger equation\n",

    "\n",
    "### The method is easily implemented for even potentials $V(x)$ in which case we can search for even and for odd bound states.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consider first even bound states. We will attempt to integrate the differential equation from $x = 0$ to $x = \\infty$. To start at $x = 0$ we need to fix $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ at this point. Since the normalization of the bound state is not determined by the equation, we can choose\n",
    "## $$ \\psi(x=0) = 1 \\quad (4.2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The derivative must also be zero at this point: if the derivative is not zero the even wavefunction will have a discontinuous derivative at $x = 0$ (can you see that?). Therefore we must set\n",
    "## $$ \\psi'(x=0) = 0 \\quad (4.3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### To integrate the differential equation we now need to choose some energy. Pick some arbitrary value $E_0$. We know already that arbitrary values of the energy do not yield bound states. So what goes wrong if we now integrate the differential equation. What happens typically is that you get a solution that could not be normalized. As you work with your computer you notice that beyond certain point along $x$ the solution diverges, perhaps by having $\\psi \\to \\infty$, that is $\\psi$ going up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### You must then change the value of the energy until you find some value $E_1$ for which the solution also diverges, but this time with $\\psi \\to -\\infty$, or $\\psi$ going down. This is a signal that there is some energy in the interval between $E_0$ and $E_1$ for which a normalizable solution exists. You then try to narrow the interval. If $E_0 < E_1$ you can do that by finding values larger than $_0$ for which the divergence is still up and values lower than $E_1$ for which the divergence is still down. As you narrow the interval you will still find these divergences, but they occur for larger and larger values of $x$. As you do so, you are getting a better and better approximation to the bound-state energy (see Fig.12).\n",
    "\n",
    "### For odd solutions, the procedure is the same, but the boundary conditions at $x = 0$ are:\n",

    "### The first is needed for a continuous odd function. The second is arbitrary, up to normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If a potential is not even but has a hard wall, this provides a good starting point for integration of the Schrodinger equation. At this point the wavefunction is set to zero and the derivative set to one. If the potential has two hard walls, we can integrate starting from one wall and then demand that the solution reach exactly zero by the time we get to the second wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A practical note: When working with computers to carry out these numerical integrations, it is first necessary to “clean out” the units from the differential equation. The first step in this process is to replace $x$ for a unit free variable $u$. The relation between them is of the form $x = bu$ where $b$ is a quantity with units of length built from the parameters in the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 12: Numerical integration of the Schrodinger equation leads to solutions that diverge up ($\\psi \\to \\infty$) or down ($\\psi \\to -\\infty$) beyond some value of $x$. Bound states are found for values of energies at which the divergence changes from up to down, or from down to up.\n",
