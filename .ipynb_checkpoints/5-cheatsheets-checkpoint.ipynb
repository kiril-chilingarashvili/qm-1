If we know ?(x, t0) for all x then the right-hand side of the Schro¬®dinger equa- tion, which just involves x derivatives and multiplication, can be evaluated at any point x.

    "3 Interpreting the Wavefunction\n",
    "Schro¬®dinger thought that the wavefunction ? represents a particle that could spread out and disintegrate. The fraction of the particle to be found at x would be proportional to the mag- nitude of |?|2. This was problematic, as noted by Max Born (1882-1970). Born solved the Schro¬®dinger equation for scattering of a particle in a potential, finding a wavefunction that fell like 1/r, with r the distance to the scattering center. But Born also noticed that in the experiment one does not find fractions of particles going in many directions but rather particles remain whole. Born suggested a probabilistic interpretation. In his proposal,\n",
