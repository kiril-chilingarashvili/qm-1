    "\n",
    "### In quantum mechanics one makes the following assumption: **Superposing a state with itself doesn’t change the physics**, nor does it change the state in a non-trivial way. Since superimposing a state with itself simply changes the overall number multiplying it, we have that $\\Psi$ and $\\alpha \\Psi$ represent the same physics for any complex number $\\alpha$ different from zero. Thus, letting $\\cong$ represent physical equivalence\n",

    "\n",
    "### Let us do a further example of superposition using electrons. Electrons are particles with spin. Classically, we imagine them as tiny balls spinning around an axis that goes through the particle itself. Once an axis is fixed, the electron has two and only two options: its rotation may be clockwise or counterclockwise about the axis, but in both cases it spins at the same fixed rate. These opposite ways of spinning are called **spin up** and **spin down** along the axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 6: An electron with spin along the $z$ axis. Left: the electron is said to have spin up along $z$. Right: the electron is said to have spin down along $z$. The up and down arrows represent the direction of the angular momentum associated with the spinning electron.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Physicists usually set up coordinate systems in space by choosing three orthogonal directions, the directions of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. Let us choose to describe our spinning electrons using the $z$ axis. One possible state of an electron is to be spin up along the $z$ axis. Such a state is described as $\\left| \\uparrow ; z \\right>$, with an arrow pointing up, and the label $z$ indicating that the spin arrow points along the increasing $z$ direction. Another possible state of an electron is spin down along the $z$ axis. Such a state is described as $\\left| \\downarrow ; z \\right> $, with an arrow pointing down, meaning this time that the spin points along the decreasing $z$ direction. If these two are possible realities, so it would be the state $\\left| \\Psi \\right>$ representing the sum\n",

    "\n",
    "### The state $\\left| \\Psi \\right>$ is in a superposition of a spin up and a spin down state. What kind of physics does this sum $\\left| \\Psi \\right>$ represent? It represents a state in which a measurement of the spin along the $z$ axis would result in two possible outcomes with equal probabilities: an electron with spin up or an electron with spin down. Since we can only speak of probabilities, any experiment must involve repetition until probabilities can be determined. Suppose we had a large ensemble of such electrons, all of them in the above state $\\left| \\Psi \\right>$. As we measured their spin along $z$, one at a time, we would find about half of them spinning up along $z$ and the other half spinning down along $z$. There is no way to predict which option will be realized as we measure each electron. It is not easy to imagine superposition, but one may try as follows. An electron in the above state is in a different kind of existence in which it is able to both be spinning up along $z$ and spinning down along $z$ simultaneously! It is in such a ghostly, eerie state, doing incompatible things simultaneously, until its spin is measured. Once measured, the electron must immediately choose one of the two options; we always find electrons either spinning up or spinning down.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A critic of quantum mechanics could suggest a simpler explanation for the above observations. He or she would claim that the following simpler ensemble results in identical experimental results. In the critic’s ensemble we have a large number of electrons with $50\\%$ of them in the state $\\left| \\uparrow ; z \\right>$ and $50\\%$ of them in the state $\\left| \\downarrow ; z \\right>$. He or she would then state, correctly, that such an ensemble would yield the same measurements of spins along $z$ as the ensemble of those esoteric $\\left| \\Psi \\right>$ states. The new ensemble could provide a simpler explanation of the result without having to invoke quantum superpositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum mechanics, however, allows for further experiments that can distinguish between the ensemble of our friendly critic and the ensemble of $\\left| \\Psi \\right> $ states. While it would take us too far afield to explain this, if we measured the spin of the electrons in the $x$ direction, instead of $z$ direction, the results would be different in the two ensembles. In the ensemble of our critic we would find $50\\%$ of the electrons up along $x$ and $50\\%$ of the electrons down along $x$. In our ensemble of $\\left| \\Psi \\right> $ states, however, we would find a very simple result: all states pointing up along $x$. The critic’s ensemble is not equivalent to our quantum mechanical ensemble. The critic is thus shown wrong in his or her attempt to show that quantum mechanical superpositions are not required."

    "## 1.5 Entanglement\n",
    "\n",
    "### When we consider superposition of states of two particles we can get the remarkable phenomenon called **quantum mechanical entanglement**. Entangled states of two particles are those in which we can’t speak separately of the state of each particle. The particles are bound together in a common state in which they are entangled with each other.\n",

    "### It may seem reasonable to conclude that the state of the full system, including particle 1 and particle 2 would be specified by stating the state of particle 1 and the state of particle 2. If that would be the case the possible states would be written as\n",
    "## $$ \\left| u_i \\right> \\otimes \\left| v_j \\right>, \\quad i,j \\in \\mathbb{N}  \\quad(5.3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### for some specific choice of $i$ and $j$ that specify the state of particle one and particle two, respectively. Here we have used the symbol $\\otimes$, which means **tensor product**, to combine the two states into a single state for the whole system. We will study $\\otimes$ later, but for the time being we can think of it as a kind of product that distributes over addition and obeys simple rules, as follows\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rcl} (\\alpha_1 \\left| u_1 \\right> + \\alpha_2 \\left| u_2 \\right>) \\otimes (\\beta_1 \\left| v_1 \\right> + \\beta_2 \\left| v_2 \\right>) & = & \\alpha_1 \\beta_1 \\left| u_1 \\right> \\otimes \\left| v_1 \\right> + \\alpha_1 \\beta_2 \\left| u_1 \\right> \\otimes \\left| v_2 \\right> \\\\ \\, & + & \\alpha_2 \\beta_1 \\left| u_2 \\right> \\otimes \\left| v_1 \\right> + \\alpha_2 \\beta_2 \\left| u_2 \\right> \\otimes \\left| v_2 \\right> \\end{array} \\quad (5.4) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The numbers can be moved across the $\\otimes$ but the order of the states must be preserved. The state on the left-hand side –expanded out on the right-hand side– is still of the type where we combine a state of the first particle $(\\alpha_1 \\left| u_1 \\right> + \\alpha_2 \\left| u_2 \\right>)$ with a state of the second particle $(\\beta_1 \\left| v_1 \\right> + \\beta_2 \\left| v_2 \\right>)$. Just like any one of the states listed in $(5.3)$ this state is not entangled.\n",

    "### A state of two particles is said to be **entangled** if it cannot be written in the factorized form $(\\cdots)\\otimes(\\cdots)$ which allows us to describe the state by simply stating the state of each particle. We can easily see that the state $(5.5)$ cannot be factorized. If it could it would have to be with a product as indicated in $(5.4)$. Clearly, involving states like $\\left| u_3 \\right>$ or $\\left| v_3 \\right>$ that do not appear in $(5.5)$ would not help. To determine the constants $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\beta_1, \\beta_2$ we compare the right hand side of $(5.4)$ with our state and conclude that we need\n",
    "## $$ \\alpha_1\\beta_1 = 1, \\quad \\alpha_1\\beta_2 = 0, \\quad \\alpha_2\\beta_1=0,\\quad \\alpha_2\\beta_2 = 1 \\quad (5.6) $$\n",

There is no way to describe the state by specifying a state for each of the particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let us illustrate the above discussion using electrons and their spin states. Consider a state of two electrons denoted as $\\left| \\uparrow \\right> \\otimes \\left| \\downarrow \\right> $. As the notation indicates, the first electron, described by the first arrow, is up along $z$ while the second electron, described by the second arrow, is down along $z$ (we omit the label $z$ on the state for brevity). This is not an entangled state. Another possible state is one where they are doing exactly the opposite: in $\\left| \\downarrow \\right>  \\otimes \\left| \\uparrow \\right> $ the first electron is down and the second is up. This second state is also not entangled. It now follows that by superposition we can consider the state\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Exercise**.\n",
    "### Show that the above state cannot be factorized and thus is indeed entangled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the state $(5.7)$ the first electron is up along $z$ if the second electron is down along $z$ (first term), or the first electron is down along $z$ if the second electron is up along $z$ (second term). There is a correlation between the spins of the two particles; they always point in opposite directions. Imagine that the two entangled electrons are very far away from each other: Alice has one electron of the pair on planet Earth and Bob has the other electron on the Moon. Nothing we know is connecting these particles but nevertheless the states of the electrons are linked. Measurements we do on the separate particles exhibit correlations. Suppose Alice measures the spin of the electron on earth. If she finds it up along $z$, it means that the first summand in the above superposition is realized, because in that summand the first particle is up. As discussed before, the state of the two particles immediately becomes that of the first summand. This means that the electron on the moon will instantaneously go into the spin down-along-$z$ configuration, something that could be confirmed by Bob, who is sitting in the moon with that particle in his lab. This effect on Bob’s electron happens before a message, carried with the speed of light, could reach the Moon telling him that a measurement has been done by Alice on the Earth particle and the result was spin up. Of course, experiments must be done with an ensemble that contains many pairs of particles, each pair in the same entangled state above. Half of the times the electron on Earth will be found up, with the electron on the Moon down and the other half of the times the electron on earth will be found down, with the electron on the moon up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our friendly critic could now say, correctly, that such correlations between the measurements of spins along $z$ could have been produced by preparing a **conventional** ensemble in which $50\\%$ of the pairs are in the state $\\left| \\uparrow \\right> \\otimes \\left| \\downarrow \\right> $ and the other $50\\%$ of the pairs are in the state $\\left| \\downarrow \\right>  \\otimes \\left| \\uparrow \\right> $. Such objections were dealt with conclusively in 1964 by John Bell, who showed that if Alice and Bob are able to measure spin in **three** arbitrary directions, the correlations predicted by the quantum entangled state are different from the classical correlations of **any** conceivable conventional ensemble. Quantum correlations in entangled states are very subtle and it takes sophisticated experiments to show they are not reproducible as classical correlations. Indeed, experiments with entangled states have confirmed the existence of quantum correlations. The kind of instantaneous action at a distance associated with measurements on well-separated entangled particles does not lead to paradoxes nor, as it may seem, to contradictions with the ideas of special relativity. You cannot use quantum mechanical entangled states to send information faster than the speed of light."

The refractive index of the coating is chosen to be intermediate between that of glass and that of air.

    "## 2.2 Elitzur-Vaidman Bombs\n",
    "\n",
    "### To see that allowing the photon to reach $D1$ by blocking a path is very strange, we consider an imaginary situation proposed by physicists Avshalom Elitzur and Lev Vaidman, from Tel-Aviv University, in Israel. They imagined bombs with a special type of trigger: a photon detector. A narrow tube goes across each bomb and in the middle of the tube there is a photon detector. To detonate the bomb one sends a photon into the tube. The photon is then detected by the photon detector and the bomb explodes. If the photon detector is defective, however, the photon is not detected at all. It propagates freely through the tube and comes out of the bomb. The bomb does not explode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here is the situation we want to address. Suppose we have a number of Elitzur-Vaidman (EV) bombs, but we know that some of them have become defective. How could we tell if a bomb is operational without detonating it? Assume, for the sake of the problem, that we are unable to examine the detector without destroying the bomb.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### We seem to be facing an impossible situation. If we send a photon into the detector tube and nothing happens we know the bomb is defective, but if the bomb is operational it would simply explode. It seems impossible to confirm that the photon detector in the bomb is working without testing it. Indeed, it is impossible in classical physics. It is not impossible in quantum mechanics, however. As we will see, we can perform what can be called an interaction-free measurement!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 7: A Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an Elitzur-Vaidman bomb inserted on the lower branch, with the detector tube properly aligned. If the bomb is faulty all incident photons will end up at D0. If a photon ends up at D1 we know that the bomb is operational, even though the photon never went into the bomb detector!\n",
    "![img](img/img-2-08.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### We now place an EV bomb on the lower path of the interferometer, with the detector tube properly aligned. Suppose we send in a photon as pictured. If the bomb is defective it is as if there is no detector, the lower branch of the interferometer is free and all the photons that we send in will end up in $D0$, just as they did in Figure 5.\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {cc} \\hline \\text{Outcome} & P \\\\ \\hline \\text{photon at}\\, D0\\, \\text{no explosion} & 1 \\\\ \\hline \\text{photon at}\\, D1\\, \\text{no explosion} & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\text{bomb explodes} & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\quad (2.24) $$\n",

    "### Assume the bomb is working. Then $50\\%$ of the times the photon will hit it and it will explode, $25\\%$ of the time the photon will end in $D0$ and we can’t tell if it is defective or not. But $25\\%$ of the time the photon will end in $D1$, and since this was impossible for a faulty bomb, we have learned that the bomb is operational! We have learned that even though the photon never made it through the bomb; it ended on $D1$. If you think about this you will surely realize it is extremely surprising and counterintuitive. But it is true, and experiments (without using bombs!) have confirmed that this kind of interaction-free measurement is indeed possible."
