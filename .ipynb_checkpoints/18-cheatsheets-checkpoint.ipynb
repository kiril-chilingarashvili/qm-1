    "### 18.1 Scattering in One Dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physicists learn a lot from scattering experiments. Rutherford learned about the structure of the atom by scattering alpha particles off thin layers of gold. We have elastic scattering if particles do not change type; this typically requires low energies. At high energies, scattering becomes quite complicated due to the creation of new particles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The scattering of a particle off a fixed target is studied by working with a particle moving in a potential, the potential created by the target. Even in the case of particle collisions it is generally possible to study the problem using center of mass coordinates and, again, considering scattering in a potential.\n",

Moreover, we have an infinite potential wall at $x = 0$. Thus all the physics happens in $x > 0$ and incoming waves from $x \\to \\infty$ will be eventually reflected back, giving the physicist information about the potential. The restriction to $x > 0$ will also be useful when we later study the more physical case of scattering in three dimensions. In that case, when using spherical coordinates, we have $r > 0$ and most of the concepts to be learned here will apply.\n",
