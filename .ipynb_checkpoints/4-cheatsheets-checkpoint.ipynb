    "## 4.1 de Broglie wavelength and Galilean transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "### We have seen that to any free particle with momentum $p$, we can associate a plane wave, or a “matter wave”, with de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda = h / p$, with $p = |\\vec{p}|$. The question is, **waves of what**? Well, this wave is eventually recognized as an example of what one calls the wavefunction. The wavefunction, as we will see is governed by the Schrodinger equation. As we have hinted, the wavefunction gives us information about probabilities, and we will develop this idea in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the wave have directional or polarization properties like electric and magnetic fields in an electromagnetic wave? Yes, there is an analog of this, although we will not delve into it now. The analog of polarization corresponds to spin! The effects of spin are negligible in many cases (small velocities, no magnetic fields, for example) and for this reason, we just use a scalar wave, a complex number\n",

    "### that depends on space and time. A couple of obvious questions come to mind. Is the wavefunction measurable? What kind of object is it? What does it describe? In trying to get intuition about this, let’s consider how different observers perceive the de Broglie wavelength of a particle, which should help us understand what kind of waves we are talking about. Recall that\n",

    "### where $k$ is the wavenumber. How would this wave behave under a change of frame?\n",
    "\n",
    "### We therefore consider two frames $S$ and $S'$ with the $x$ and $x'$ axes aligned and with $S'$ moving to the right along the $+x$ direction of $S$ with constant velocity $v$. At time equal zero, the origins of the two reference frames coincide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The time and spatial coordinates of the two frames are related by a **Galilean transformation**, which states that\n",
    "## $$ x'=x-vt, \\quad t'=t \\quad (1.3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indeed time runs at the same speed in all Galilean frames and the relation between $x$ and $x'$ is manifest from the arrangement shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 1: The $S'$ frame moves at speed $v$ along the $x$-direction of the $S$ frame. A particle of mass $m$ moves with speed $\\tilde{v}$, and thus momentum $p = m\\tilde{v}$, in the $S$ frame.\n",
    "![img](img/img-4-01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now assume both observers focus on a particle of mass $m$ moving with nonrelativistic speed. Call the speed and momentum in the $S$ frame $\\tilde{v}$ and $p = m\\tilde{v}$, respectively. It follows by differentiation with respect to $t = t'$ of the first equation in $(1.3)$ that\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{dx'}{dt'} = \\frac{dx}{dt}-v \\quad (1.4) $$\n",

    "### which means that the particle velocity $\\tilde{v}'$ in the $S'$ frame is given by\n",
    "## $$ \\tilde{v}' = \\tilde{v} - v \\quad (1.5) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiplying by the mass $m$ we find the relation between the momenta in the two frames\n",
    "## $$ p' = p - mv \\quad (1.6) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The momentum $p'$ in the $S'$ frame can be appreciably different from the momentum $p$ in the $S$ frame. Thus the observers in $S'$ and in $S$ will obtain rather different de Broglie wavelengths $\\lambda'$ and $\\lambda$! Indeed,\n",
    "## $$ \\lambda' = \\frac{h}{|p'|} = \\frac{h}{|p-mv|} \\neq \\lambda \\quad (1.7) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is very strange! As we review now, for ordinary waves that propagate in the rest frame of a medium (like sound waves or water waves) Galilean observers will find frequency changes but no change in wavelength. This is intuitively clear: to find the wavelength one need only take a picture of the wave at some given time, and both observers looking at the picture will agree on the value of the wavelength. On the other hand to measure frequency, each observers must wait some time to see a full period of the wave go through them. This will take different time for the different observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let us demonstrate these claims quantitatively. We begin with the statement that the phase $\\phi = kx - \\omega t$ of such a wave is a Galilean invariant. The wave itself may be $\\cos(\\phi)$ or $\\sin(\\phi)$ or some combination, but the fact is that the physical value of the wave at any point and time must be agreed by the two observers. The wave is an observable. Since all the features of the wave (peaks, zeroes, etc, etc) are controlled by the phase, the two observers must agree on the value of the phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the $S$ frame the phase can be written as follows\n",
    "## $$ \\phi = kx -\\omega t = k\\left(x-\\frac{\\omega}{k}t\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} (x-Vt) = \\frac{2\\pi x}{\\lambda} - \\frac{2\\pi V}{\\lambda}t \\quad (1.8) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### where $\\displaystyle V = \\frac{\\omega}{k}$ is the wave velocity. Note that the wavelength is read from the coefficient of $x$ and $\\omega$ is minus the coefficient of $t$. The two observers should agree on the value of $\\phi$. That is, we should have\n",

    "## $$ \\phi'(x', t') = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} (x-Vt) = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} (x' + vt' - Vt') = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}x - \\frac{2\\pi(V-v)}{\\lambda}t' \\quad (1.10) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Since the right-hand side is expressed in terms of primed variables, we can read $\\lambda'$ from the coefficient of $x'$ and $\\omega'$ as minus the coefficient of $t'$:\n",
    "## $$ \\begin{array} {rclr} \\lambda' & = & \\lambda & (1.11) \\\\ \\omega' & = & \\displaystyle \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}(V-v) = \\frac{2\\pi V}{\\lambda}\\left(1-\\frac{v}{V}\\right) = \\omega (1-\\frac{v}{V}) & (1.12) \\end{array} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### This confirms that, as we claimed, for a physical wave propagating in a medium, the wavelength is a Galilean invariant and the frequency transforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what does it mean that the wavelength of matter waves change under a Galilean transformation? It means that the $\\Psi$ waves are not directly measurable! Their value does not correspond to a measurable quantity for which all Galilean observers must agree. Thus, the wavefunction need not be invariant under Galilean transformations:\n",

    "### 1. If we superpose matter waves to form a wave-packet that represents the particle, the packet will move with the so called group velocity $v_g$, which in fact coincides with the velocity of the particle.
