    "### Quantum mechanics is now almost one-hundred years old, but we are still discovering some of its surprising features and it remains the subject of much investigation and speculation. The framework of quantum mechanics is a rich and elegant extension of the framework of classical physics. It is also counterintuitive and almost paradoxical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum physics has replaced classical physics as the correct fundamental description of our physიcal universe. It is used routinely to describe most phenomena that occur at short distances. Quantum physics is the result of applying the framework of quantum mechanics to different physical phenomena. We thus have Quantum Electrodynamics, when quantum mechanics is applied to electromagnetism, Quantum Optics, when it is applied to light and optical devices, or Quantum Gravity, when it is applied to gravitation. Quantum mechanics indeed provides a remarkably coherent and elegant framework. The era of quantum physics begins in 1925, with the discoveries of Schrodinger and Heisenberg. The seeds for these discoveries were planted by Planck, Einstein, Bohr, de Broglie, and others. It is a tribute to human imagination that we have been able to discover the counterintuitive and abstract set of rules that define quantum mechanics. Here we aim to explain and provide some perspective on the main features of this framework.\n",
    "### We will begin by discussing the property of linearity, which quantum mechanics shares with elec- tromagnetic theory. This property tells us what kind of theory quantum mechanics is and why, it could be argued, it is simpler than classical mechanics. We then turn to photons, the particles of light. We use photons and polarizers to explain why quantum physics is not deterministic and, in contrast with classical physics, the results of some experiments cannot be predicted. Quantum mechanics is a framework in which we can only predict the probabilities for the various outcomes of any given experiment. Our next subject is quantum superpositions, in which a quantum object somehow manages to exist simultaneously in two mutually incompatible states. A quantum light-bulb, for example, could be in a state in which it is both on and off at the same time!\n"

    "## Linearity of the equations of motion\n",
    "\n",
    "### In physics a theory is usually described by a set of equations for some quantities called the **dynamical variables** of the theory. After writing a theory, the most important task is finding solutions of the equations. A solution of the equations describes a possible reality, according to the theory. Because an expanding universe is a solution of Albert Einstein’s gravitational equations, for example, it follows that an expanding universe is possible, according to this theory. A single theory may have many solutions, each describing a possible reality.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### There are linear theories and nonlinear theories. Nonlinear theories are more complex than linear theories. In a linear theory a remarkable fact takes place: if you have two solutions you obtain a third solution of the theory simply by adding the two solutions. An example of a beautiful linear theory is Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, a theory that governs the behavior of electric and magnetic fields. A field, as you probably know, is a quantity whose values may depend on position and on time. A simple solution of this theory describes an electromagnetic wave propagating in a given direction. Another simple solution could describe an electromagnetic wave propagating in a different direction. Because the theory is linear, having the two waves propagating simultaneously, each in its own direction and without affecting each other, is a new and consistent solution. The sum is a solution in the sense that the electric field in the new solution is the sum of the electric field in the first solution plus the electric field in the second solution. The same goes for the magnetic field: the magnetic field in the new solution is the sum of the magnetic field in the first solution plus the magnetic field in the second solution. In fact you can add any number of solutions to still find a solution. Even if this sounds esoteric, you are totally familiar with it. The air around you is full of electromagnetic waves, each one propagating oblivious to the other ones. There are the waves of thousands of cell phones, the waves carrying hundreds of wireless internet messages, the waves from a plethora of radio-stations, TV stations, and many, many more. Today, a single transatlantic cable can carry simultaneously millions of telephone calls, together with huge amounts video and internet data. All of that courtesy of linearity.\n",

    "### More concretely, we say that Maxwell’s equations are linear equations. A solution of Maxwell’s equation is described by an electric field $E$ a magnetic field $B$, a charge density $\\rho$ and a current density $J$, all collectively denoted as $(E, B, \\rho, J)$. This collection of fields and sources satisfy Maxwell’s equations.

It was Max Born, who months later suggested that the wavefunction encodes probabilities. This was the correct physical interpretation, but it was thoroughly disliked by many, including Schrodinger, who remained unhappy about it for the rest of his life.

    "2 Complex Numbers are Essential\n",
    "Quantum mechanics is the first physics theory that truly makes use of complex numbers. The numbers most of us use for daily life (integers, fractions, decimals) are real numbers. The set of complex numbers is denoted by C and the set of real numbers is denoted by R. Complex numbers appear when we combine real numbers with the imaginary unit i, defined to be equal to the square root of minus one: i ? ?1. Being the square root of minus one, it means that i squared must give minus one: i2 = ?1. Complex numbers are fundamental in mathematics. An equation like x2 = ?4, for an unknown x cannot be solved if x has to be real. No real number squared gives you minus one. But if we allow for complex numbers, we have the solutions x = ±2i.

    "3 Loss of Determinism\n",
    "Maxwell’s crowning achievement was the realization that his equations of electromagnetism allowed for the existence of propagating waves. In particular, in 1865 he conjectured that light was an elec- tromagnetic wave, a propagating fluctuation of electric and magnetic fields. He was proven right in subsequent experiments. Towards the end of the nineteenth century physicists were convinced that light was a wave. The certainty, however, did not last too long. Experiments on blackbody radiation and on the photo-emission of electrons suggested that the behavior of light had to be more complicated than that of a simple wave. Max Planck and Albert Einstein were the most prominent contributors to the resolution of the puzzles raised by those experiments.\n",
    "   In order to explain the features of the photoelectric effect, Einstein postulated (1905) that in a light beam the energy comes in quanta – the beam is composed of packets of energy. Einstein essentially implied that light was made up of particles, each carrying a fixed amount of energy. He himself found this idea disturbing, convinced like most other contemporaries that, as Maxwell had shown, light was a wave. He anticipated that a physical entity, like light, that could behave both as a particle and as a wave could bring about the demise of classical physics and would require a completely new physical theory. He was in fact right. Though he never quite liked quantum mechanics, his ideas about particles of light, later given the name photons, helped construct this theory.\n",
    "   It took physicists until 1925 to accept that light could behave like a particle. The experiments of Arthur Compton (1923) eventually convinced most skeptics. Nowadays, particles of light, or photons, are routinely manipulated in laboratories around the world. Even if mysterious, we have grown accustomed to them. Each photon of visible light carries very little energy – a small laser pulse can\n",

    "contain many billions of photons. Our eye, however, is a very good photon detector: in total darkness, we are able to see light when as little as ten photons hit upon our retina. When we say that light behaves like a particle we mean a quantum mechanical particle: a packet of energy and momentum that is not composed of smaller packets. We do not mean a classical point particle or Newtonian corpuscle, which is a zero-size object with definite position and velocity.\n",

Light that is linearly polarized along the xˆ direction namely, light whose electric field points in this direction, goes through the polarizer.

    "   So far so good. But now, let us try to understand this result by thinking about the photons that make up the incident light. The premise here is that all photons in the incident beam are identical. Moreover the photons do not interact with each other. We could even imagine sending the whole energy of the incident light beam one photon at a time. Since all the light that emerges from the polarizer has the same frequency as the incident light, and thus the same frequency, we must conclude that each individual photon either goes through or is absorbed. If a fraction of a photon went through it would be a photon of lower energy and thus lower frequency, which is something that does not happen.\n",
    "But now we have a problem. As we know from the wave analysis, roughly a fraction (cos ?)2 of the\n",
    "photons must go through, since that is the fraction of the energy that is transmitted. Consequently a fraction 1 ? (cos ?)2 of the photons must be absorbed. But if all the photons are identical, why is it that what happens to one photon does not happen to all of them?\n",
    "   The answer in quantum mechanics is that there is indeed a loss of determinism. No one can predict if a photon will go through or will get absorbed. The best anyone can do is to predict probabilities. In this case there would be a probability (cos ?)2 of going through and a probability 1 ? (cos ?)2 of failing to go through.\n",
    "   Two escape routes suggest themselves. Perhaps the polarizer is not really a homogeneous object and depending exactly on where the photon his it either gets absorbed or goes through. Experiments show this is not the case. A more intriguing possibility was suggested by Einstein and others. A possible way out, they claimed, was the existence of hidden variables. The photons, while apparently identical, would have other hidden properties, not currently understood, that would determine with certainty which photon goes through and which photon gets absorbed. Hidden variable theories would seem to be untestable, but surprisingly they can be tested. Through the work of John Bell and others, physicists have devised clever experiments that rule out most versions of hidden variable theories. No one has figured out how to restore determinism to quantum mechanics. It seems to be an impossible task.\n",

    "We have already discussed the concept of linearity; the idea that the sum of two solutions representing physical realities represents a new, allowed, physical reality. This superposition of solutions has a straightforward meaning in classical physics. In the case of electromagnetism, for example, if we have two solutions, each with its own electric and magnetic field, the “sum” solution is simply understood: its electric field is the sum of the electric fields of the two solutions and its magnetic field is the sum of the magnetic fields of the two solutions. In quantum mechanics, as we have explained, linearity holds. The interpretation of a superposition, however, is very surprising.\n",

Our beam-splitters will be balanced: they split a given beam into two beams of equal intensity (Figure 3). The light that bounces off is called the reflected beam, the light that goes through is called the transmitted beam. The incident beam can hit the beam splitter from the top or from the bottom.\n",

At BS2 the beams are recombined and sent into two outgoing beams that go into photon detectors D0 and D1.\n",

These two contributions interfere constructively to give a beam going into D0. Two contributions also go towards D1: the transmission from ‘a’ at BS2 and the reflection from ‘b’ at BS2. These two can indeed be arranged to interfere destructively to give no beam going into D1.\n",
    "   It is instructive to think of the incoming beam as a sequence of photons that we send into the interferometer, one photon at a time. This shows that, at the level of photons, the interference is not interference of one photon with another photon. Each photon must interfere with itself to give the result. Indeed interference between two photons is not possible: destructive interference, for example, would require that two photons end up giving no photon, which is impossible by energy conservation. Therefore, each photon does the very strange thing of going through both branches of the inter- ferometer! Each photon is in a superposition of two states: a state in which the photon is in the top beam or upper branch, added to a state in which the photon is in the bottom beam or lower branch.\n",

    "   When we speak of a wavefunction, we also sometimes call it a state, because the wavefunction specifies the “state” of our quantum system. We also sometimes refer to states as vectors. A quantum state may not be a vector like the familiar vectors in three-dimensional space but it is a vector nonetheless because it makes sense to add states and to multiply states by numbers. Just like vectors can be added, linearity guarantees that adding wavefunctions or states is a sensible thing to do. Just like any vector can be written as a sum of other vectors in many different ways, we will do the same with our states. By writing our physical state as sums of other states we can learn about the properties of our state.\n",

    "   Let us do a further example of superposition using electrons. Electrons are particles with spin. Classically, we imagine them as tiny balls spinning around an axis that goes through the particle itself. Once an axis is fixed, the electron has two and only two options: its rotation may be clockwise or counterclockwise about the axis, but in both cases it spins at the same fixed rate. These opposite ways of spinning are called spin up and spin down along the axis (see Figure 6). The up and down refer to the direction of the angular momentum associated with the rotation, and it is indicated by an arrow. According to quantum mechanics, and as verified by multiple experiments, the same possibilities, up or down, arise whatever axis we use to measure the spin of the electron.\n",
    "   Physicists usually set up coordinate systems in space by choosing three orthogonal directions, the directions of the x, y, and z axes. Let us choose to describe our spinning electrons using the z axis. One possible state of an electron is to be spin up along the z axis. Such a state is described as | ? ; z), with an arrow pointing up, and the label z indicating that the spin arrow points along the increasing z direction. Another possible state of an electron is spin down along the z axis. Such a state is described as | ? ; z), with an arrow pointing down, meaning this time that the spin points along the decreasing z direction. If these two are possible realities, so it would be the state |?) representing the sum\n",

As we measured their spin along z, one at a time, we would find about half of them spinning up along z and the other half spinning down along z. There is no way to predict which option will be realized as we measure each electron. It is not easy to imagine superposition, but one may try as follows. An electron in the above state is in a different kind of existence in which it is able to both be spinning up along z and spinning down along z simultaneously! It is in such a ghostly, eerie state, doing incompatible things simultaneously, until its spin is measured. Once measured, the electron must immediately choose one of the two options; we always find electrons either spinning up or spinning down.\n",

    "   Quantum mechanics, however, allows for further experiments that can distinguish between the ensemble of our friendly critic and the ensemble of |?) states. While it would take us too far afield to explain this, if we measured the spin of the electrons in the x direction, instead of z direction, the results would be different in the two ensembles. In the ensemble of our critic we would find 50% of the electrons up along x and 50% of the electrons down along x. In our ensemble of |?) states, however, we would find a very simple result: all states pointing up along x. The critic’s ensemble is not equivalent to our quantum mechanical ensemble. The critic is thus shown wrong in his or her attempt to show that quantum mechanical superpositions are not required.\n",

There is a correlation between the spins of the two particles; they always point in opposite directions. Imagine that the two entangled electrons are very far away from each other: Alice has one electron of the pair on planet earth and Bob has the other electron on the moon. Nothing we know is connecting these particles but nevertheless the states of the electrons are linked. Measurements we do on the separate particles exhibit correlations. Suppose Alice measures the spin of the electron on earth. If she finds it up along z, it means that the first summand in the above superposition is realized, because in that summand the first particle is up. As discussed before, the state of the two particles immediately becomes that of the first summand. This means that the electron on the moon will instantaneously go into the spin down-along-z configuration, something that could be confirmed by Bob, who is sitting in the moon with that particle in his lab. This effect on Bob’s electron happens before a message, carried with the speed of light, could reach the moon telling him that a measurement has been done by Alice on the earth particle and the result was spin up. Of course, experiments must be done with an ensemble that contains many pairs of particles, each pair in the same entangled state above. Half of the times the electron on earth will be found up, with the electron on the moon down and the other half of the times the electron on earth will be found down, with the electron on the moon up.\n",

    "spins along z could have been produced by preparing a conventional ensemble in which 50% of the pairs are in the state | ?) ? | ?) and the other 50% of the pairs are in the state | ?) ? | ?). Such objections were dealt with conclusively in 1964 by John Bell, who showed that if Alice and Bob are able to measure spin in three arbitrary directions, the correlations predicted by the quantum entangled state are different from the classical correlations of any conceivable conventional ensemble. Quantum correlations in entangled states are very subtle and it takes sophisticated experiments to show they are not reproducible as classical correlations. Indeed, experiments with entangled states have confirmed the existence of quantum correlations. The kind of instantaneous action at a distance associated with measurements on well-separated entangled particles does not lead to paradoxes nor, as it may seem, to contradictions with the ideas of special relativity. You cannot use quantum mechanical entangled states to send information faster than the speed of light.\n",
